# Simple React Todo List - No Hooks

This is a simple React Todo App that is not making use of React hooks. It's simply using state to create and remove the task. This is a small app so there's not too much design and file structure to it.

# Usage

First, you need to clone or download the repository. After you've done that, you need to CD into that directory and type the following into your terminal:

```
npm install
```

or

```
npm i
```

After you've done that, while still in your terminal, type the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server and app. Play around and do what you want at this point.

After that, if you want to deploy to production, while in your terminal, type the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will give you a build for production. 

# Objectives

I wanted to build a todo app with react that doesn't use hooks, and instead focuses on state usage. I did that. The next time I build a todo app without hooks I'll clean it up a bit and implement a better overall layout.
